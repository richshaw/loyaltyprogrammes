# Are loyalty programs effective?

The short answer is that we don't know. There's some evidence to suggest that loyalty programs are beneficial to businesses and consumers, but ultimately it's not clear if loyalty programs are profitable or if they should be treated as a profit center.

The literature on loyalty programs is large and often contradictory. Fortunately, I found a recent literature review that gives a good summary what we *know* and *don't know* about the effectiveness of loyalty programs.
